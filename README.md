## Data Cleaning and Loading to PostgreSQL (Aiven)
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning raw data using Python and loading the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database hosted on Aiven. It serves as a foundational pipeline for data preprocessing and storage, suitable for analytics, reporting, or further data processing tasks.

## Project Overview
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning workflows. Raw datasets often contain inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and other issues that can lead to inaccurate insights. This project utilizes Python's powerful libraries to:

Load and inspect raw datasets

Handle missing values and duplicates

Normalize and encode data

Clean column names and remove irrelevant features

Load the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database

###Technologies Used
Python 3.6+: Programming language for data processing

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library

Scikit-learn: Tools for data preprocessing

psycopg2: PostgreSQL adapter for Python

Aiven for PostgreSQL: Managed PostgreSQL service

 ###Data Cleaning Techniques
 --
This project employs various data cleaning techniques:

Handling Missing Values: Filling or dropping missing data

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records

Normalization: Scaling numerical features to a standard range

Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical data into numerical format

Feature Selection: Removing irrelevant or redundant features

### PostgreSQL Connection Configuration
--
To connect to your PostgreSQL database on Aiven, ensure you have the following details:

Host: Your Aiven PostgreSQL service hostname

Port: Typically 5432

Database Name: The name of your database

User: Your database username

Password: Your database password
